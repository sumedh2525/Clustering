    "Q1. What are the different types of clustering algorithms, and how do they differ in terms of their approach and underlying assumptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various clustering algorithms, and they can be broadly categorized into the following types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical Clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach: It creates a tree of clusters, known as a dendrogram, by recursively merging or splitting existing clusters.\n",
    "Assumptions: Assumes a hierarchy of clusters, allowing for both agglomerative (bottom-up) and divisive (top-down) approaches.\n",
    "Partitioning Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach: Divides data into non-overlapping subsets or clusters.\n",
    "Assumptions: Assumes that each cluster can be represented by a prototype, and points within a cluster are more similar to each other than to points in other clusters. Examples include K-means and K-medoids.\n",
    "Density-Based Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach: Clusters are areas with higher point density separated by areas of lower point density.\n",
    "Assumptions: Assumes that clusters are regions with higher density separated by lower-density regions. Examples include DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise).\n",
    "Model-Based Clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach: Assumes that the data is generated by a mixture of probability distributions.\n",
    "Assumptions: Assumes that the data is generated by a probabilistic model. Examples include Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)."
